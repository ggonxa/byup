Create Store landing page
index.html

In the header had the options to 
Log in - login.php
Sign Up - signup.php
Cart - cart.php

From the landing page you can go to "Temples"
Display the products- product.php
With buy you add products to shopping cart

From cart you go to checkout - checkout.php

I use a template call "Skeleton" with some personal modifications.
The template has two css - normalize and skeleton that control the Responsiveness and layout.
I add Style.css for style customization.

Cart and Checkout has some javascript to modify the quantity, remove products, etc.

I create a database with 3 tables.
Users - when sign up store the profile of the user. Also is use to check the user name and password when login.
Products - All the product information, name, price, description, picture, etc.
Cart - Every time you buy a product collect the information of the user and the product. Is use also in the cart to display all the items that the buyer is collecting.
I start open the database in the login page but for time issues didn't used in the other pages with php extension.

Way to work.
Create a draft of the pages in paper.
For lack of time didn't do a photoshop mockup, and also didn't connect the pages or pass info from one to another.
But my style is keep it simple and do general to specific, first page layout, second links, third scripts, four database, etc.

Thanks
